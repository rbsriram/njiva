- Make tasks clear and actionable
- Preserve context (dates, times, details)
- Do not split tasks unless explicitly stated
- Do not create new/unrelated tasks
- Only categorize and clarify existing input
- Ensure items for shopping cart are not included in Do. Keep all entries logically unique. And do not have duplicate entries which mean the same thing.
- Also ensure that you do not take any of the examples given below in this prompt as the input.


### Categorization Examples:
     Do:
    - "Team meeting next Tuesday 2pm"
    - "Submit report by Friday"
    - "Doctor appointment tomorrow 3pm"
    - "Call mom tonight"
    - "Dinner reservation Saturday"
    - "Pick up kids at 5pm"

    Plan: 
    - "Research summer vacation options"
    - "Plan quarterly budget"
    - "Learn Spanish"
    - "Explore new job opportunities"
    - "Prepare presentation"
    - "Compare insurance plans"

    Think:
    - "Blog post ideas"
    - "Team productivity improvements"
    - "Living room design concepts"
    - "Story plot ideas"
    - "Business opportunities"
    - "Social media themes"

    Shopping List:
    - "Buy milk, eggs and bread"  
    - "Get new laptop"
    - "Purchase office supplies"
    - "Groceries: vegetables, fruits"
    - "Order birthday gift"
    - "Get cleaning supplies"

    Important Dates/Events:
    - "Mom's birthday March 15"
    - "Wedding anniversary June 21"
    - "Tax filing deadline April 15"
    - "School year starts September 1"
    - "Christmas day December 25"
    - "Company fiscal year end"

    ### Key Classification Rules:
    1. If it's actionable with a specific date/time ‚Üí Do
    2. If it's a significant life event or annual occasion ‚Üí Important Dates/Events
    3. If it involves buying/purchasing ‚Üí Shopping List
    4. If it needs research/preparation ‚Üí Plan
    5. If it's an idea/concept ‚Üí Think;`;

  // Method to generate the deduplication section of the prompt
  private static buildDeduplicationRules(): string {

- Compare new vs previous items
- Remove exact duplicates
- Merge semantically similar items
- Prioritize most specific entry`;
  }

  // Method to generate the date/time handling section of the prompt
  private static buildDateTimeRules(config: DateTimeConfig): string {
    return `
    ### Date and Time Processing Rules:

    1. Current Reference Date: ${config.currentDate}
    Use this as the base date for all date calculations.

    2. Date Output Requirements:
    - MUST output actual calculated dates, never placeholders
    - Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-01-10)
    - All dates must be equal to or after ${config.currentDate}
    - No date should have explicit "YYYY" in it or "MM", they should always resolved to a valid date and not placeholders. The only exception is "null"

    3. Basic Date Terms:
    - "today" ‚Üí current date (${config.currentDate})
    - "tomorrow" ‚Üí next calendar day (${config.currentDate} + 1 day)
    - "day after" or "next day" ‚Üí next calendar day (same as tomorrow)
    - "day after tomorrow" ‚Üí current date + 2 days

    4. Weekday Calculations:
    a) For "this [weekday]" or "coming [weekday]":
    - If the weekday hasn't occurred yet this week, use this week's date
    - If the weekday has already passed this week, use next week's date
    - Example when current date is Monday (${config.currentDate}):
      * "this/coming Monday" = 2025-01-20 (already passed, so next week)
      * "this/coming Tuesday" = 2025-01-14 (this week)
      * "this/coming Wednesday" = 2025-01-15 (this week)
      * "this/coming Thursday" = 2025-01-16 (this week)
      * "this/coming Friday" = 2025-01-17 (this week)
      * "this/coming Saturday" = 2025-01-18 (this week)
      * "this/coming Sunday" = 2025-01-19 (this week)

    b) For "next [weekday]" or "following [weekday]":
    - Always use the weekday in the following week
    - "Following" means exactly the same as "next"
    - Example when current date is Monday (${config.currentDate}):
      * "next/following Monday" = 2025-01-20
      * "next/following Tuesday" = 2025-01-21
      * "next/following Wednesday" = 2025-01-22
      * "next/following Thursday" = 2025-01-23
      * "next/following Friday" = 2025-01-24
      * "next/following Saturday" = 2025-01-25
      * "next/following Sunday" = 2025-01-26

    5. Other "Next/Following" Terms:
    a) For "next week" or "following week":
    - Add 7 days to the current date
    - If no specific day mentioned, use Monday of next week
    - Example: "next week" or "following week" on ${config.currentDate} = 2025-01-20

    b) For "next month" or "following month":
    - If a date is specified (e.g., "next month 15th"), use that date in the next month
    - If no date specified, use the 1st of next month
    - Example: "next month 15th" from ${config.currentDate} = 2025-02-15

    6. Time Processing Rules:
    - Format: HH:mm (24-hour format)
    - If no time specified, set as null
    - Convert 12-hour format to 24-hour (e.g., "3pm" ‚Üí "15:00")

    7. Recurrence Rules:
    - daily: occurs every day
    - weekly: occurs every week on the same day
    - monthly: occurs every month on same date
    - yearly: occurs every year on same date
    - null: one-time event

    8. IMPORTANT: Keywords and their meanings:
    - "this/coming" refers to this week's occurrence (or next week if already passed)
    - "next/following" always refers to the following week's occurrence
    - "next" and "following" are exactly equivalent and should be treated the same way'
    - Ensure you DO NOT take the dates mentioned in the example as the current date, the current date will always be ${config.currentDate}`;
